### Alternatives and Their Downsides:

1. **Using an Array**:
    - If you were to use an array, checking if a section is expanded would involve using `.includes()` to find the section, which has a time complexity of O(n).
    - Removing a section from an array would involve finding its index and using `.splice()`, which again involves O(n) operations for both finding and modifying the array.
    
    ``` js
    // Example with array
    const newOpenSections = [...openSections];
    const index = newOpenSections.indexOf(value);
    if (index !== -1) {
      newOpenSections.splice(index, 1);  // Collapse section
    } else {
      newOpenSections.push(value);       // Expand section
    }
    
    ```
    
2. **Using an Object**:
    - You could use an object where the keys are the section `value` and the values are `true`/`false` (expanded or collapsed). However, this makes toggling slightly more verbose because you'd need to flip between `true` and `false` values explicitly.
    
    ``` js
    // Example with object
    setOpenSections((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      [value]: !prev[value],
    }));
    
    ```
    

### Conclusion:

A `Set` is a natural fit for this problem because:

- It ensures uniqueness (only one instance of a section in the expanded state).
- It provides O(1) time complexity for checking, adding, and removing sections.
- The operations are simple and concise, leading to cleaner and more readable code.

In summary, using a `Set` allows for efficient, straightforward toggling of multiple independent sections in the Accordion, without the complexity of managing duplicates or inefficient lookups.
